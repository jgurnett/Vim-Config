# Vim-Config
This is my very simply vim config, There isn't much to it, I didn't just want to take someone elses
config so I am just adding as I go.

if it fails let me know.


## Installation

1. First make sure that you've backed up or removed your own vim files (`.vimrc`, `.vim/`).
2. Clone the repo to your home directory: `git clone https://github.com/jgurnett/Vim-Config.git ~/.vim`
3. cd .vim/
4.	Give script execute permissions: `chmod +x install.sh`
5. `./install.sh`. This creates a symbolic link called `.vimrc` in your home directory, so you are free to edit the .vimrc in this repo and your changes will be observed. It also installs all the plugins using Vundle (this could take a bit of time).
